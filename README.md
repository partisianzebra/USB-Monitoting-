# USB-Monitoting

This code can detect any usb insertion or deletion from a computer. The interesting thing in this code is it can detect the change from a whole network of computers i.e if any device is detached from a particular computer in a network a message is triggered for the server system showing the ip address and the name of the computer from which the device is removed.

Requirements:
install python 7.x
run code

If you have any doubt regarding the code please feel free to contact me through partisianzebra@gmail.com.


Merci:)
